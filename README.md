# animation-files
The files I use to make my YouTube show Happy Object World, along with other animations. I'll only upload what I feel like I need to. Most people won't care about this, but I'm sure some people will.

I animate with Turbowarp 1.12.3, which is a mod of Scratch with many new and useful features. These projects will break if you open them with the Scratch offline editor. Download Turbowarp here: https://desktop.turbowarp.org/
